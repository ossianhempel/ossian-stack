# Springs And Stagger

Read for spring tuning or staggered entrances. Follow the scope and safety contract in the skill entry point.

## Spring Animations

Springs feel more natural than duration-based animations because they simulate real physics. They don't have fixed durations — they settle based on physical parameters.

### When to use springs

- Drag interactions with momentum
- Elements that should feel "alive" (like Apple's Dynamic Island)
- Gestures that can be interrupted mid-animation
- Decorative mouse-tracking interactions

### Spring-based mouse interactions

Tying visual changes directly to mouse position feels artificial because it lacks motion. Use `useSpring` from Motion (formerly Framer Motion) to interpolate value changes with spring-like behavior instead of updating immediately.

```jsx
import { useSpring } from 'framer-motion';

// Without spring: feels artificial, instant
const rotation = mouseX * 0.1;

// With spring: feels natural, has momentum
const springRotation = useSpring(mouseX * 0.1, {
  stiffness: 100,
  damping: 10,
});
```

This works because the animation is **decorative** — it doesn't serve a function. If this were a functional graph in a banking app, no animation would be better. Know when decoration helps and when it hinders.

### Spring configuration

**Apple's approach (recommended — easier to reason about):**

```js
{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }
```

**Traditional physics (more control):**

```js
{ type: "spring", mass: 1, stiffness: 100, damping: 10 }
```

Keep bounce subtle (0.1-0.3) when used. Avoid bounce in most UI contexts. Use it for drag-to-dismiss and playful interactions.

### Interruptibility advantage

Springs maintain velocity when interrupted — CSS animations and keyframes restart from zero. This makes springs ideal for gestures users might change mid-motion. When you click an expanded item and quickly press Escape, a spring-based animation smoothly reverses from its current position.
## Stagger Animations

When multiple elements enter together, stagger their appearance. Each element animates in with a small delay after the previous one. This creates a cascading effect that feels more natural than everything appearing at once.

```css
.item {
  opacity: 0;
  transform: translateY(8px);
  animation: fadeIn 300ms ease-out forwards;
}

.item:nth-child(1) {
  animation-delay: 0ms;
}
.item:nth-child(2) {
  animation-delay: 50ms;
}
.item:nth-child(3) {
  animation-delay: 100ms;
}
.item:nth-child(4) {
  animation-delay: 150ms;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

Keep stagger delays short (30-80ms between items). Long delays make the interface feel slow. Stagger is decorative — never block interaction while stagger animations are playing.
