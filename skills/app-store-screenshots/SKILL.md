# App Store & Google Play Screenshots Generator

## Overview

Scaffold a pre-built Next.js + ShadCN editor that lets the user design and export App Store **and** Google Play screenshots as **advertisements** (not UI showcases). The editor handles all the heavy lifting:

- Live preview at the canvas's true resolution (scaled to fit)
- Drag-to-reorder slides, inline text editing, layout switcher per slide
- Drop-target screenshot picker (file → saved to `public/screenshots/uploaded/<hash>.png`)
- Auto-save to **`app-store-screenshots.json`** at the project root (git-trackable) + `localStorage` mirror
- Easy iOS ↔ Android platform switch — separate slide decks live side by side
- One-click bulk PNG export at every Apple/Google-required resolution via `html-to-image`
- Light/dark variant toggle per slide, theme presets, locale select

Supported devices out of the box:
- **iPhone** (portrait) — Apple App Store
- **iPad** (portrait) — Apple App Store
- **Android Phone** (portrait) — Google Play
- **Android Tablet 7"** (portrait + landscape) — Google Play
- **Android Tablet 10"** (portrait + landscape) — Google Play
- **Feature Graphic** (1024×500 banner) — Google Play store listing header

## Core Principle

**Screenshots are advertisements, not documentation.** Every screenshot sells one idea. If you're showing UI, you're doing it wrong — you're selling a *feeling*, an *outcome*, or killing a *pain point*. Use this skill's interactive editor to iterate on copy and layout fast; do not hand-craft the page from scratch.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Copies a pre-built template** from `template/` (co-located with this `SKILL.md`) into the user's working directory.
2. Installs dependencies with the user's package manager.
3. Drops the user's screenshots into `public/screenshots/...` and their app icon into `public/`.
4. Writes a copy-first screenshot story from the user's pain, outcome, proof, and feature list.
5. Prefills `src/lib/defaults.ts` with the user's app name and starting copy so the first preview is meaningful.
6. Starts the dev server and tells the user to open the editor in the browser.

You should NOT write `page.tsx`, device frames, or export logic by hand. They live in the template.

## Step 1: Gather Input (Before Scaffolding)

Ask the user these. Do not proceed until you have answers:

### Required

1. **App screenshots** — "Do you already have screenshots of the devices?"
   - If **yes**: ask "Where are your app screenshots? (PNG files of actual device captures)" and proceed.
   - If **no** and the app is **iOS + Swift**: offer the companion capture skill — "Want to capture them automatically with the `ios-marketing-capture` skill (https://github.com/ParthJadhav/ios-marketing-capture)?" If they say yes, install it with:
     ```bash
     npx skills add ParthJadhav/ios-marketing-capture
     ```
     Then have them run that skill first to generate the screenshots before continuing here.
   - If **no** and the app is **not iOS + Swift** (e.g. Android, React Native, Flutter, web): the capture skill won't work — the user needs to capture screenshots manually (simulator/device screenshots) before continuing.
2. **App icon** — "Where is your app icon PNG?"
3. **App name** — "What's the app called?"
4. **Feature list** — "List your app's features in priority order. What's the #1 thing your app does?"
5. **User pain** — "What frustration, delay, anxiety, or repeated annoyance does the app remove?"
6. **After-state** — "What changes for the user after they use it?"
7. **Proof** — "What proof can we show? Examples: ratings, users, streaks, speed, before/after result, testimonial, saved time, real output."
8. **Style direction** — "What style do you want? You can either (a) pick one of the named deep-spec styles, or (b) describe your own vibe in your own words (warm/organic, dark/moody, clean/minimal, bold/colorful, plus any reference apps you like) and I'll build a custom palette. The template also ships with `clean-light`, `dark-bold`, `warm-editorial`, and `ocean-fresh` palette presets you can start from. The named deep specs live in `style-prompts/` — see `style-prompts.md` for the full index. Currently available: Retro Rubberhose Mascot, Moody Curated Dating, Paper Sticker Skeuomorphic, Dreamy Pastel Couples, Hand-Drawn Editorial Tasks, Glossy 3D K-Beauty Creator. If the user names one of these — or describes something that clearly matches one — read `style-prompts/_QUALITY_BAR.md` first, then the matching deep spec file, and apply its entire spec (palette, gradients, shadows, rotations, per-slide breakdown). If the user describes a fully custom style, fall back to the General Visual Design Principles below and pick the closest deep spec as a starting reference."

### Optional

9. **Target stores** — Apple App Store only, Google Play only, or both? Determines which platform decks to seed.
10. **iPad / Android tablet screenshots** — If yes, what sizes and orientations?
11. **Feature Graphic** — Want a 1024×500 Play Store banner too?
12. **Localized screenshots** — Languages? (e.g. en, de, es, pt, ja, ar, he)
13. **Number of slides** — Apple allows up to 10, Google Play up to 8.
14. **Brand colors / font** — If they want a custom theme beyond the four presets.
15. **Additional instructions** — Anything specific.

**IMPORTANT:** If the user gives instructions at any point, follow them. They override skill defaults.

## Step 2: Write the Screenshot Story

Do this before scaffolding. Screenshots convert when the text tells the story and the UI acts as evidence. Do not start from the feature list and do not seed generic feature labels.

### Copy-First Deck Outline

Draft the first version of the deck in this order:

| Slot | Purpose | Headline job |
|------|---------|--------------|
| #1 | **Name the pain** | Make the target user feel seen before they know the feature set |
| #2 | **State the shift** | Show what changes once they use the app |
| #3 | **Show proof** | Use ratings, usage, a concrete result, or a believable output |
| #4-5 | **Feature delivery** | Show the one or two features that prove the shift |
| #6+ | **Expansion** | Ecosystem, secondary features, feature wall, or phone mosaic |

Skip slots that genuinely do not fit, but keep the order. If the first three screenshots work in any sequence, the deck is a catalog, not a story.

### Rewrite Features Into Outcomes

Turn feature labels into user-facing outcomes before putting them into `defaults.ts`.

| Weak feature label | Better screenshot headline |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| Customizable dashboard | See everything that matters |
| Workout tracking | Never forget what you lifted |
| Notes to slides | Stop designing slides |
| Auto-numbering | Never fix slides manually again |

Keep each headline to one idea. If a headline needs two clauses to make sense, split it into another slide or use the feature as a subline/proof element.

### Copy Gate Before Scaffolding

Before editing `src/lib/defaults.ts`, check:

- The first slide names a pain, desire, or clear after-state; it is not the app category.
- The first three slides read in order: pain -> shift -> proof.
- Every headline still works if the UI is covered.
- Every headline is 8 words or fewer unless the user explicitly chooses a more editorial style.
- Feature names support the promise; they are not the promise.

## Step 3: Scaffold the Template

### Detect Package Manager

Priority: **bun > pnpm > yarn > npm**.

```bash
which bun && echo bun || which pnpm && echo pnpm || which yarn && echo yarn || echo npm
```

### Copy the Template

The template lives at `<this skill dir>/template/` — when the skill is installed, the whole folder is already on disk. Copy its contents (NOT the folder itself) into the user's working directory. The trailing `/.` copies dotfiles like `.gitignore` too.

```bash
# Replace <SKILL_DIR> with the absolute path to this skill (the directory containing SKILL.md).
cp -R "<SKILL_DIR>/template/." "$PWD/"
```

If the target directory already has a `package.json`, ask the user before overwriting. For an in-place upgrade, copy only the files the user hasn't customized.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install      # or pnpm install / yarn / npm install
```

### Drop the User's Assets

Move the user's screenshots into the layout the template expects:

```
public/
├── app-icon.png                      # ← user's app icon
├── mockup.png                        # ← already copied by the template (iPhone bezel)
└── screenshots/
    ├── apple/
    │   ├── iphone/{locale}/01.png … N.png
    │   └── ipad/{locale}/01.png   … N.png
    └── android/
        ├── phone/{locale}/01.png  … N.png
        ├── tablet-7/{portrait|landscape}/{locale}/...
        └── tablet-10/{portrait|landscape}/{locale}/...
```

The default sample slides reference filenames `01.png`–`05.png` per device under `en/`. If the user names their screenshots differently, either rename them or update `src/lib/defaults.ts` so the initial deck points at the right files. The user can also drag-drop files directly into the editor at runtime — those become embedded data URIs and don't need to live on disk.

### Seed Initial Copy

Use the copy-first deck from Step 2 to edit `src/lib/defaults.ts` and set:
- `appName`
- `tagline`
- `themeId` (one of `"clean-light" | "dark-bold" | "warm-editorial" | "ocean-fresh"`, or add a new entry to `THEMES` in `src/lib/constants.ts`)
- Starter slides per device with the user's `label` + `headline` + screenshot paths

Do not leave generic defaults when the user has provided enough context to write a first pass. The editor should open on a real marketing story, not placeholder feature labels.

### Start the Dev Server

```bash
bun dev    # → http://localhost:3000
```

Tell the user to open the URL and start editing. The editor auto-saves to **`app-store-screenshots.json`** at the project root (plus a `localStorage` mirror for instant paint). Uploaded screenshots land in `public/screenshots/uploaded/<hash>.png`. Both are git-trackable — committing them means another machine can `git clone` and resume the exact deck.

## Step 4: Coach the User on Copy

Inside the editor the user will write headlines themselves, but they often need guidance. Apply these rules when reviewing their copy or generating suggestions.

### The Iron Rules

1. **One idea per headline.** Never join two things with "and."
2. **Short, common words.** 1-2 syllables. No jargon unless it's domain-specific.
3. **3-5 words per line.** Must be readable at thumbnail size in the App Store.
4. **Line breaks are intentional.** Newlines in the textarea map directly to visible breaks.

### Three Approaches

| Type | What it does | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Paint a moment** | You picture yourself doing it | "Check your coffee without opening the app." |
| **State an outcome** | What your life looks like after | "A home for every coffee you buy." |
| **Kill a pain** | Name a problem and destroy it | "Never waste a great bag of coffee." |

### Bad-to-Better

| Weak | Better | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Track habits and stay motivated | Keep your streak alive | one idea, faster to parse |
| Organize tasks with AI summaries | Turn notes into next steps | outcome-first, less jargon |
| Save recipes with tags and favorites | Find dinner fast | sells the benefit, not the UI |

### Narrative Arc

The user's slide deck should follow the copy-first arc from Step 2. Skip slots that do not fit, but preserve the sequence:

| Slot | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| #1 | **Pain / Main After-State** — the ONLY slide most people see |
| #2 | **Shift** — what becomes easier, calmer, faster, clearer, or more satisfying |
| #3 | **Proof** — ratings, users, concrete result, before/after, real output |
| #4-5 | **Feature Delivery** — the capabilities that make the shift believable |
| 2nd-to-last | **Ecosystem / Differentiator** — widgets, watch, integrations, unique angle |
| Last | **Feature Wall or Phone Mosaic** — extras only after the main story is sold |

### Layout Variation

Vary the `layout` field across slides. The editor exposes:
- `hero` — centered headline + bottom-anchored device
- `device-bottom` — same composition, smaller headline
- `device-top` — flipped, device above caption (good contrast slide)
- `two-devices` — back + front phones layered
- `no-device` — big standalone headline (use sparingly)
- `split-landscape` — caption left + device right (tablet landscape only)
- `feature-graphic` — Play Store banner (1024×500)

Never repeat the same layout twice in a row. Use 1-2 `inverted` (dark) slides for visual rhythm.

## Visual Design Principles

These rules are derived from studying the best app store screenshots in the wild (Superlist, Headspace, CRED, (Not Boring) Camera, Arc Search, Linktree, Gentler Streak, etc.). They apply regardless of which style preset the user picks. Style-specific tokens (fonts, palette, accents) live in `style-prompts.md` — point the user there.

### 1. The background is a designed surface — never white

Plain white is the amateur tell. Every great deck uses a deliberate surface: a saturated color block, a warm cream/off-white (`#F4F1EC`-ish), a dark navy/near-black, or a gradient. The background can shift per slide (Headspace, Linktree do this), but it must read as intentional, not default.

### 2. Headlines dominate

The headline occupies roughly the **top 30–40%** of the canvas — much bigger than a typical web hero. If a person can't read it at thumbnail size with no zoom, redesign.

### 3. Mixed emphasis inside the headline

Almost every great headline has one word styled differently from the rest — a contrast color, an italic script, a heavier weight, or a hand-drawn underline. Examples:
- Superlist: "The one app that fits **your whole day**" (script + coral)
- Headspace: "Stress **less**" (`less` orange against black)
- Arc Search: "**Fastest** way to search. **Cleanest** way to browse." (purple / navy)

Flat single-color headlines look weaker. Pick one emphasis word per slide.

### 4. Decorative accents are the rule, not the exception

Top decks layer at least one of these on most slides:
- Hand-drawn squiggles, arrows, scribbles (Superlist)
- Sparkles / glow (Gentler Streak, Arc)
- Label badges on the visual ("SUPER RAW", "Cinematic", "LUT")
- Floating widget chips with real stats ("$3,630 earned", "11,175 steps") — these tell the story without copy
- Award lockups on the hero only (Apple Design Award, Webby, star count)

A bare phone on a bare bg with a bare headline is the default-skill output. Add one accent.

### 5. Phone framing is a deliberate choice — vary it across the deck

Three common framings, each carries a different feeling:
- **Bezelless / minimal frame** — maximizes UI legibility, modern (Arc, Linktree, Gentler)
- **Tilted floating phone with soft shadow** — product / advertorial feel (Superlist, CRED hero)
- **Full device with visible bezel, dead-center** — editorial, premium (CRED, NB Camera)

Mix at least two framings across the deck.

### 6. Proof anchors the hero, nothing else

Award badges, press quotes, star counts, install counts — concentrate them on **slide 1 only**. Spreading them dilutes both the proof and the rest of the slides. NB Camera does this perfectly: Verge quote + Apple Design Award + 15,000+ stars all on the cover, none after.

### 7. Density inside the phone, sparsity outside

The screenshot inside the phone can (and should) be a real, dense product capture — actual lists, dashboards, charts, conversations. The space *outside* the phone is the opposite: one headline, one visual, one optional sub-line, one optional badge. Don't add bullet lists, multi-line paragraphs, or competing logos around the device.

### 8. Break the phone parade

Every 2–3 slides, drop the phone and use a different hero element to keep visual rhythm:
- 3D rendered product object (NB Camera's stylized camera)
- Photographic still (NB Camera slide 2)
- Real human / lifestyle photo (Linktree)
- Mascot illustration (Headspace's mascot, Gentler Streak's character)
- Typographic feature wall (Superlist's last slide)
- Phone grid mosaic (Linktree's "Trusted by 70M+" final slide)

### 9. Last slide pattern

The closer is almost always one of two things:
- **Feature wall** — a vertical list of one-word features styled as big type ("Real-time collaboration / Offline support / Widgets / Integrations…")
- **Phone mosaic** — multiple bezelless mini-screenshots arranged in a grid to convey "look at all the things this does"

Pick one. Don't make the last slide another single-feature hero — it wastes the spot.

### 10. Thumbnail test (mandatory before export)

Shrink the slide to ~160px wide (App Store search-result size). Squint. Can you read the headline? Can you tell what the app does in under a second? If not, the headline is too long, the type is too thin, or there's no contrast between text and background. Fix before exporting.

## Step 5: Localization

**Always confirm the language list with the user before scaffolding** — even if they didn't volunteer it. Ask: _"Should screenshots be localized? If yes, which locales? (e.g. en, de, es, pt, ja)."_ Default to English-only if they say no or skip.

The project state file (`app-store-screenshots.json`) carries a `locales: string[]` field — the list of locale codes the project targets. The editor reads this to decide:
- The locale dropdown in the toolbar is **hidden** when `locales.length <= 1`.
- The dropdown's options come from this list (not a hardcoded set).
- The **Export bundle** loops every locale in the list × every required size.

**After scaffolding, edit `app-store-screenshots.json` to set `locales` to the user's chosen list, e.g.** `"locales": ["en", "de", "ja"]`. Also set `"locale": "en"` (or whichever is the source-of-truth language) so the editor opens on it.

The editor stores headlines and labels per-locale on each slide — switch to a locale and type to fill it in; unfilled locales fall back to `en` at preview time. Screenshots are a single string per slide; put `{locale}` anywhere in the path and the editor substitutes the active locale at render and export (e.g. `/screenshots/iphone/{locale}/01.png`).

- Don't literally translate — rewrite for the target market.
- Re-check line breaks per locale; German/French/Portuguese often need shorter claims.
- For RTL (`ar`, `he`, `fa`, `ur`), the template handles direction inversion through CSS — let the user verify each slide looks intentional, not just flipped.

## Step 6: Export Time

Inside the editor, the user picks a device, then hits **Export bundle**. A single zip downloads with every required size × every project locale for that device, organized as `<platform>/<device>/<WxH>/<locale>/NN-<layout>.png`. Repeat per device.

Project locales come from `app-store-screenshots.json` `locales` field — set during scaffolding (Step 5). Single-locale projects produce a flat per-size structure with just the one locale folder.

If exports come out blank or with black screen rectangles:
- Verify source screenshots are RGB (not RGBA). The template flattens via `objectFit: cover`, but truly transparent sources can still produce black regions.
- Confirm preload completed — check the browser console for `preloadImages` errors.
- The export double-call (`toPng` twice in a row) is built-in; do not remove it.

## Step 7: Final QA Gate

### Message Quality
- One idea per slide
- Hero slide names the pain or after-state in one second
- First three slides read in order: pain -> shift -> proof
- Headlines still sell when the UI is covered
- Feature labels have been rewritten into user outcomes
- Headlines are 8 words or fewer unless the style intentionally calls for longer editorial copy
- Readable at arm's length at thumbnail size

### Visual Quality
- No two adjacent slides share the same layout
- Landscape tablet slides use `split-landscape` — never two devices side-by-side
- At least one contrast (`inverted: true`) slide when the deck is long enough

### Export Quality
- No clipped text or assets after scaling to export size
- Screenshots correctly aligned inside every device frame
- Filenames sort correctly (zero-padded numeric prefixes)
- Feature Graphic exports cleanly at 1024×500 (no device frame)

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Edited `page.tsx` instead of using the editor | Roll back the edit; let users iterate in the browser |
| Tried to rebuild device frames from scratch | They're in `src/components/editor/device-frames.tsx` — modify there |
| Pasted screenshots into git directly | `public/screenshots/...` is fine to commit. Drop-target uploads are now also written to `public/screenshots/uploaded/<hash>.png` — commit both that folder **and** `app-store-screenshots.json` so collaborators reproduce your deck after `git clone`. |
| Wrong directory layout for tablet screenshots | See Step 3 — `android/tablet-7/portrait/{locale}/...` etc. |
| Reset wiped the deck | Reset clears in-memory state and re-saves defaults to `app-store-screenshots.json`. Recover by `git checkout app-store-screenshots.json` if it was committed, or export first before resetting. |
| Export is blank | Source PNGs probably have alpha — flatten to RGB |
| `bun dev` port collision | Template defaults to `next dev`; let Next pick the next free port (3001+) |

## Hand-off Behavior

When you finish scaffolding, **start the dev server** (`bun dev` / `pnpm dev` / `yarn dev` / `npm run dev`) and then tell the user the following, in this order:

1. **The server is running at `http://localhost:3000`** (or whichever port Next picked — read it from the dev server output and quote the actual URL). Tell them to open it in the browser.
2. **How to run it next time** — give them the exact two-command recipe for their package manager:
   ```bash
   bun install   # only needed the first time, or after pulling new deps
   bun dev       # → http://localhost:3000
   ```
   Substitute `pnpm` / `yarn` / `npm run` as appropriate for what was detected in Step 3.
3. Which platforms have starter decks seeded (iOS, Android, or both).
4. Any user-supplied screenshots that didn't match the expected filenames (so they can rename or use the in-editor drop target).
5. Point them at the **Export bundle** button once they're happy with the layouts.
6. **Invite further edits:** say something like _"Feel free to ask me to make any changes you'd like to the screenshots — copy, layout, palette, anything. I can iterate with you."_
7. **Showcase callout** (always include this, verbatim spirit):
